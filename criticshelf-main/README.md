# CriticShelf

A web application for logging reviews/ratings of any media you consume.

Letterboxd/Goodreads, but for: Movies, Books, TV, Music and Video Games.

# Technology

Built in React and Rails, styled with Material UI.
Database managed with PostgreSQL.
Hosted on Heroku.

# Story

CriticShelf was born when Goodreads ignored my emails about adding half-stars to their rating system.

It was a final project at the Flatiron School's Full-Stack Software Engineer Bootcamp.

# Version 0.5

CriticShelf is in its first launched version, v0.5
In 0.5, users can review and rate media, and view their "shelf" of reviews.
Users can see a piece of media's average rating and number of ratings.
Known Issues:
• It is deeply, deeply mobile unfriendly. Use a computer.
• The search function can be a bit finnicky if you speed type through it.
• The Music database is a bit incomplete for some modern releases.
1.0 Goals:
• Adding Friends, and viewing other users' shelves
• A feed of recent reviews and new releases
• Users naming their "Favorites" and "GOAT" pieces of media
• Improved styling and a mobile-friendly site.
